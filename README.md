# Script
Repositary containing diverses script that I wrote mostly for scientific purpose

bellow the name of each file a brief description of what it does is given :

Execution_diagram.py :

The script performs static code analysis on your Python project to visualize the relationships between .py files, classes, functions, imports, and outputs. It uses the ast module to parse Python source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and graphviz to generate a visual diagram of the execution flow.
